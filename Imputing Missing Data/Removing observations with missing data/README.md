# **Removing observations with missing data**

Complete Case Analysis (CCA), also called list-wise deletion of cases, consists of discarding those observations where the values in any of the variables are missing. CCA
can be applied to categorical and numerical variables. CCA is quick and easy to implement and has the advantage that it preserves the distribution of the variables, provided the data
is missing at random and only a small proportion of the data is missing. However, if data is missing across many variables, CCA may lead to the removal of a big portion of the
dataset.
