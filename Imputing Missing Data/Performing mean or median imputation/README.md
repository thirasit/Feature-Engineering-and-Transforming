# **Performing mean or median imputation**

To perform mean or median imputation using the scikit-learn and Feature-engine libraries and pandas for comparison. Mean or median imputation consists of replacing missing values with the variable mean or
median. This can only be performed in numerical variables. The mean or the median is calculated using a train set, and these values are used to impute missing data in train and test sets, as well as in future data we intend to score with the machine learning model.
