# **Assembling an imputation pipeline with scikit-learn**

Datasets often contain a mix of numerical and categorical variables. In addition, some
variables may contain a few missing data points, while others will contain quite a big
proportion. The mechanisms by which data is missing may also vary among variables.
Thus, we may wish to perform different imputation procedures for different variables. In
this work, we will learn how to perform different imputation procedures for different
feature subsets using scikit-learn.
