# **Implementing random sample imputation**

Random sampling imputation consists of extracting random observations from the pool of
available values in the variable. Random sampling imputation preserves the original
distribution, which differs from the other imputation techniques we've discussed in this
folder (Imputing Missing Data) and is suitable for numerical and categorical variables alike. In this work, we will
implement random sample imputation with pandas and Feature-engine.
