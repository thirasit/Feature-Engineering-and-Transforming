# **Performing one-hot encoding of frequent categories**

One-hot encoding represents each category of a categorical variable with a binary variable.
Hence, one-hot encoding of highly cardinal variables or datasets with multiple categorical
features can expand the feature space dramatically. To reduce the number of binary
variables, we can perform one-hot encoding of the most frequent categories only. In this work, we will learn how to implement one-hot encoding of the most popular
categories using pandas and Feature-engine.
