# **Encoding Categorical Variables**

Encoding Categorical Variables, introduces various classical and widely used
techniques to transform categorical variables into numerical variables and also
demonstrates a technique for reducing the dimension of highly cardinal variables as well as
how to tackle infrequent values. This work also includes more complex techniques for
encoding categorical variables, as described and used in the 2009 KDD competition.
