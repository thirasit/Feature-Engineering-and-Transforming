# **Creating binary variables through one-hot encoding**

In one-hot encoding, we represent a categorical variable as a group of binary variables,
where each binary variable represents one category. The binary variable indicates whether
the category is present in an observation (1) or not (0). In this work, we will learn how to perform one-hot encoding using pandas, scikit-learn,
and Feature-engine.
